### Day 1 / 02.11.2019/
Ivelin, Lora and Dimo started the project. The previous robot left in the laboratory room by M.Raikova was dismantled. Software required
for the project was researched profoundly and main idea of how the robot would like was devised.
First ideas:
- main hand to fold the pages
- specific place where the given book will be left for forlding
- secondary hand to push the pages so the main hand could fold it
- sensor to check for the presence of left-oout pages /abandoned feature after consideration about the construction/

### Day 2 /04.11.2019/
All the members of the project gather in the laboratory room to begin the project. Teodor, Ivelin and Iskren, Dimo work on the construction
of the robot and the software respectively. Lora, Ivon and Georgi are doing reseach on how to create a video for the presentation, taking 
photos of the members while they do their given task and doing the documentation. By 6 PM the group has finished constructing the robot,
and has started tuning the software part, so the robot makes smooth and correct moves. By 8 PM Ivelin, Teodor, Iskren and Dimo have 
made the software part, which works as intended, but need a bit of tuning. 

### Day 3 /07.11.2019/
Lora, Ivon, Teodor and Dimo are at the laboratory room, doing final tuning and conversing about the presentation on 11.11.2019. Iskren, 
Georgi are working on the video for the presentation. Ivelin prepares for the lecture by using the auto-generated construction manual by 
the Lego Designer software.
